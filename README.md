  Bank Customers Churn Prediction
</div>

## ðŸš©Project Description

> Welcome to the Credit Card Customer Churn Analysis project! This Project contains a comprehensive analysis of a dataset from a bank that aims to understand and mitigate customer 
churn. Churn refers to customers who stop using a bank's credit card services. The dataset includes various customer characteristics, historical transaction data, and the binary target variable indicating whether a customer has churned or not.

## ðŸš©Key Objectives

> The primary objectives of this project are threefold:
>* Identify the most critical customer characteristics that influence credit card customer churn.
>* Develop and compare three ML models: logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to predict customer churn.
>* Provide actionable recommendations to help bank managers reduce customer churn.

## ðŸš©Project Highlights

> We began by cleaning the dataset, encoding the target variable, handling outliers, and optimizing categorical variables. Next, we conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the data's distribution and relationships. We found that variables such as the total number of transactions, total transaction amount, and total revolving balance were significant predictors of churn.
>
>In the modeling phase, we implemented logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models. The random forest model emerged as the top performer with the highest accuracy and F1-Score, making it the ideal choice for predicting customer churn.

## ðŸš©Recommendations

>Based on our findings, we recommend that the bank closely monitors customers' total transactions, transaction amounts, and revolving balances. If these values fall below a certain threshold, it is advisable to proactively engage with customers to prevent churn. This proactive approach can significantly reduce the loss of customers and contribute to long-term business growth.
